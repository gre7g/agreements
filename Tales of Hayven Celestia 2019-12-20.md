# Tales of Hayven Celestia
## First Anthology
Agreement between G7L and RG on 12/29/2019
## Notes
* Unless otherwise specified, any references to the book refer to both print and eBook editions.
## Not Covered
This agreement does not cover how we will divvy up tasks for the project. These have been falling out naturally and I see no reason to bother codifying it.
## Covered
### Expenses
Expenses include:
* Royalties promised to contributors

RG will pay 100% of the expenses
### Credits
On both the book cover and any electronic listings (Amazon, G7L's shopping cart, etc.) the book will be listed as edited by RG & G7L (or just last names thereof on the book cover if that fits better).

Contributing authors will be listed inside the book and may or may not be itemized in any online listing.
### Online Hosting
RG will upload the .pdf's to his Amazon account. Amazon royalties will be paid directly into his bank account.

RG may list the book for sale on his website, at conventions, or other personal venues as he wishes.

G7L may list the book for sale on his website, at conventions, or other personal venues as he wishes.

Before entering into any deals to expand distribution of the book beyond those listed above, RG & G7L agree to discuss and amend this agreement.
### Royalty Payout
RG will keep 100% of all proceeds from the sales via Amazon, his website, at conventions, etc.

G7L will keep 100% of all proceeds from the sales on his website, at conventions, etc.
### Purchase Agreement
When G7L needs to order additional copies of the book for sale on his website, at conventions, etc., he will request that RG put in an order for him and pay RG 100% of the expense. Should RG be buying books at the same time, they will split the shipping expenses, otherwise G7L will cover them as part of the purchase. RG will add no additional fees beyond those charged by Amazon.
